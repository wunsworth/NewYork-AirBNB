# New York AirBNB data analysis

## Introduction to data
We have a dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data) which contains all of the listings of accomodation for New York City on AirBNB for the year 2019. It includes location, price, and a variety of other features which are discussed in more detail in the Jupyter notebook.

## Python requirements
Our EDA and machine learning is all carried out in a Jupyter Notebook. We will be using:
* Numpy: for general mathematics and array functionality
* Pandas: for data handling
* Folium: for plotting geospatial data
* SKlearn: for machine learning
